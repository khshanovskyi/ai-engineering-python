class AIClient(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for AI service clients.

    This class defines the interface that all AI service implementations must follow.
    It handles common initialization logic and requires concrete implementations for
    both synchronous and asynchronous response methods.

    Attributes:
        _api_key (str): The API key for authenticating with the AI service.
        _base_url (str): The base URL of the AI service API. Concrete clients
            append the specific path to it (e.g. "/chat/completions"), and the
            official SDKs accept it as their `base_url` argument.
        _model_name (str): The name/identifier of the AI model to use.
        _system_prompt (str): The system prompt that guides the AI's behavior.

        Initialize the AI client with required configuration.

            base_url (str): The base URL of the AI service API. Custom HTTP clients
                build the full request URL as "{base_url}/{path}"; SDK clients pass
                it straight to the official library as its `base_url`.
            model_name (str): The specific model identifier to use.
            api_key (str): The API key for authentication.
            system_prompt (str): The system-level instruction for the AI model.
